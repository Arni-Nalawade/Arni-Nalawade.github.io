                    <h4>Here is a little information about me</h4>
                    <p>I completed my education uptil grade 10 in India where I was involved in co-curricular activties like Bharatnatyam, drawing and painting competitions and was also a 
                        journalist for the school's monthly magazine. <br> I immigrated to Canada in grade 11 and attended Laurel Heights Secondary School (formerly known as Sir John A MacDonald Secondary School). There I was a 
                        part of various clubs such as the Science Fair Club, DECA (Decathon Competition club) and the Key Club. As a member of DECA I participated in the entrepreneurship 
                        competition and cleared district level. Through the Key Club I had the oppurtunity to volunteer at the Volunteer Action Centre (VAC). I received my OSSD (Ontario Secondary School Diploma) in August 2021 and was admitted 
                        to Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
                        <br> At UWaterloo engineering I was a part of design teams like WARG (Waterloo Arial Robotics Group) and UWAFT (University of Waterloo
                        Alternative Fuels Team). I am also a part of the digital arts club where I am learning techniques of digital drawing.
                        <br> I love connecting with people and learning about new technologies. I aspire to be part of projects and teams focused on machine learning 
                        and software.

                            I wanted to improve my web development skills and decided to create a website which showcases me and my skills. 
                            The website was made using <b> HTML5, CSS and Javascript </b>, in addition I also used different web development libraries and CDNs to improve functionality and performance. These incude JQuery, Google font API and Font Awesome.

                            A Sumobot which I made using custom PCB made by UV radiation etching and designed using Traxxmaker software. The robot chassis 
                            was made using various woodcutting tools. It is capable of opponent detection, pit-maneuvers and edge detection.
                            I designed this robot from the groundup and am very proud of how it turned out. It won 4th place in the local robot fighting tournament.

                                    change increased engineering resource efficiency by 26%.
                                    <br>- Attended "feedback meetings" with clients and presented the prototype drawings of their proposed sunrooms. These meetings
